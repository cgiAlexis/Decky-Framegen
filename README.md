# Decky Framegen Plugin

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/B0B71HZTAX)

## What This Plugin Does
A Steam Deck plugin that enables DLSS upscaling and Frame Generation on handhelds by utilizing the latest OptiScaler and supporting modification software. This plugin automatically installs and manages all necessary components for FSR-based frame generation in games that support DLSS, or OptiFG for adding FG to games that do not have any existing FG pathway (highly experimental)

## More information
- [Wiki](https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen/wiki)

## Features
This plugin uses OptiScaler to replace DLSS calls with FSR3/FSR3.1, giving you:
- **Frame Generation**: Doubles your frame rate using AMD's FSR3 pathways
- **Upscaling**: Improves performance while maintaining visual quality using FSR and XESS using DLSS FSR or XESS inputs. Upgrade FSR 2 games to FSR 3.1.4 or XESS for better visual quality.
- **Easy Management**: One-click installation and game patching/unpatching through the Steam Deck interface. No going into desktop mode every time you want to add or remove OptiScaler from a game!


### Core Functionality
- **One-Click Setup**: Automatically downloads and installs OptiScaler into a "fgmod" directory
- **Smart Installation**: Handles all required dependencies and library files
- **Game Patching**: Easy copy-paste launch commands for enabling/disabling the mod per game
- **OptiScaler Wiki**: Direct access to OptiScaler documentation and settings via a webpage launch button right inside the plugin.

## How to Use
1. **Install the Plugin**: Download and install through Decky Loader "install from zip" option in developer settings
2. **Setup OptiScaler**: Open the plugin and click "Setup OptiScaler Mod" 
3. **Configure Games**: For each game you want to enhance:
   - Click "Copy Patch Command" in the plugin
   - Go to your game's Properties â†’ Launch Options in Steam
   - Paste the command: `~/fgmod/fgmod %command%`
4. **Enable Features**: Launch your game and enable DLSS in the graphics settings
5. **Advanced Options**: Press the Insert key in-game for additional OptiScaler settings

### Removing the Mod from Games
- Click "Copy Unpatch Command" and replace the launch options with: `~/fgmod/fgmod-uninstaller.sh %command%`
